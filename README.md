Todo App

Please build a &#39;todo&#39; web app that will allow user&#39;s to see a list of items. This application will first
pull the todo data from the &#39;jsonplaceholder&#39; api url provided below. We encourage you to review
the api documentation and briefly familiarize yourself with the endpoint. User&#39;s should then be
able to see this data in a table or data-table.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Limit each API call to any number between 10-40 rows.
- If possible, add pagination to the table.
- Make sure the application is responsive and mobile-screen friendly.
- Make sure that any error or failure states are handled.
- Add comments where you feel your code needs explanation.
